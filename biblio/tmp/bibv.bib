In the present article, we describe the basic techniques that are by now well established in the field. We first give a general overview of the formulation of the visual servo control problem. We then describe the two archetypal visual servo control schemes: image-based and position-based visual servo control. Finally, we discuss performance and stability issues that pertain to these two schemes, motivating the second article in the series, in which we consider advanced techniques.}},

    abstract = {{This article is the second of a two-part tutorial on visual servo control. In this tutorial, we have only considered velocity controllers. It is convenient for most of classical robot arms. However, the dynamics of the robot must of course be taken into account for high speed task, or when we deal with mobile nonholonomic or underactuated robots. As for the sensor, geometrical features coming from a classical perspective camera is considered. Features related to the image motion or coming from other vision sensors necessitate to revisit the modeling issues to select adequate visual features. Finally, fusing visual features with data coming from other sensors at the level of the control scheme will allow to address new research topics.}},
